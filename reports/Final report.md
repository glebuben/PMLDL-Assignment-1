# Introduction
In this assignment I tried to build a solution for text detoxification.
Problem definition was already explored in **solution building**, so please
check that report for advanced information.

First, I tried to create a custom transformer, but failed.

Second, from experience gained from building transformer, I 
decided that custom solutions are not so reliable as I thought.
Thus, I switched to pretrained models. I Fine-tuned T5-small
on my preprocess dataset and get adequate result

Finally, I found pretrained model on initial dataset. And decided
that I should not invent a wheel, and I will use found solution as a
final one
# Data analysis
Initial data analysis showed that there are some troubles in the
raw dataset. They were solved in the **1_0_initial_data_exporation.ipynb**,
so please check it
# Model Specification
All models specifications are given in **solution building report**
# Training Process
It is also considered in **solution building report**
# Evaluation
This considered in **solution building report** as well
# Results
Final results I consider as pretty decent, you can check them in 
**solution building report**
